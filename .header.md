# AWS VPC Module

This module can be used to deploy a pragmatic VPC with various subnets types in # AZs. Common deployment examples can be found in [examples/](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-vpc/tree/main/examples). Subnet CIDRs can be explicitly set via list of string argument `cidrs` or set via a number `netmask` argument.

_Note: For information regarding the 2.0 upgrade see our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-vpc/blob/main/UPGRADE-GUIDE-2.0.md)._

## Usage

The example below builds a VPC with public and private subnets in 3 AZs. Each subnet calulates a CIDR based on the `netmask` argument passed. The public subnets build nat gateways in each AZ but optionally can be switched to `single_az`.

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source   = "aws-ia/vpc/aws"
  version = ">= 1.0.0"

  name       = "multi-az-vpc"
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/20"
  az_count   = 3

  subnets = {
    public = {
      name_prefix               = "my_public" # omit to prefix with "public"
      netmask                   = 24
      nat_gateway_configuration = "all_azs" # options: "single_az", "none"
    }

    private = {
      # omitting name_prefix defaults value to "private"
      # name_prefix  = "private_with_egress"
      netmask      = 24
      route_to_nat = "0.0.0.0/0"
    }
  }

  vpc_flow_logs = {
    log_destination_type = "cloud-watch-logs"
    retention_in_days    = 180
  }
}
```

## Reserved Subnet Key Names

There are 2 reserved keys for subnet key names in var.subnets corresponding to types "public" and "transit_gateway". Other custom subnet key names are valid are and those subnets will be private subnets.

```terraform
subnets = {
  public = {
    name_prefix               = "my-public" # omit to prefix with "public"
    netmask                   = 24
    nat_gateway_configuration = "all_azs" # options: "single_az", "none"
  }

  # naming private is not required, can use any key
  private = {
    # omitting name_prefix defaults value to "private"
    # name_prefix  = "private"
    netmask      = 24
    route_to_nat = "0.0.0.0/0"
  }

  # can be any valid key name
  privatetwo = {
    # omitting name_prefix defaults value to "privatetwo"
    # name_prefix  = "private"
    netmask      = 24
    route_to_transit_gateway = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
  }
}
```

## Updating a VPC with new or removed subnets

If using `netmask` to calculate subnets and you wish to either add or remove subnets (ex: adding / removing an AZ), you may have to change from using `netmask` for some subnets and set to explicit instead. Private subnets are always calculated before public.

When changing to explicit cidrs, subnets are always ordered by AZ. `0` -> a, `1` -> b, etc.

Example: Changing from 2 azs to 3

Before:
```hcl
cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
az_count = 2

subnets = {
  public = {
   netmask = 24
  }

  private = {
   netmask = 24
  }
}
```

After:
```hcl
cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
az_count = 3

subnets = {
  public = {
   cidrs = ["10.0.0.0/24", "10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.4.0/24"]
  }

  private = {
   cidrs = ["10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24", "10.0.5.0/24"]
  }
}
```

The above example will cause only creating 2 new subnets in az `c` of the region being used.

## Output usage examples

The outputs in this module attempt to align to a methodology of outputting resource attributes in a reasonable collection. The benefit of this is that, most likely, attributes you want access to are already present without having to create new `output {}` for each possible attribute. The [potential] downside is that you will have to extract it yourself using HCL logic. Below are some common examples:

### Extracting subnet IDs for private subnets

Example Configuration:
```terraform
module "vpc" {
  source  = "aws-ia/vpc/aws"
  version = ">= 1.0.0"

  name       = "multi-az-vpc"
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/20"
  az_count   = 3

  subnets = {
    private = { netmask = 24 }
  }
}
```

Extracting subnet_ids to a list (using `terraform console` for example output):
```terraform
> [ for _, value in module.vpc.private_subnet_attributes_by_az: value.id]
[
  "subnet-04a86315c4839b519",
  "subnet-02a7249c8652a7136",
  "subnet-09af79b5329b3681f",
]
```

Alternatively, since these are maps, you can use key in another resource `for_each` loop. The benefit here is that your dependent resource will have keys that match the AZ the subnet is in:

```terraform
resource "aws_route53recoveryreadiness_cell" "cell_per_az" {
  for_each = module.vpc.private_subnet_attributes_by_az

  cell_name = "${each.key}-failover-cell-for-subnet-${each.value.id}"
}
...
```

Terraform Plan:

```shell
# aws_route53recoveryreadiness_cell.cell_per_az["us-east-1a"] will be created
+ resource "aws_route53recoveryreadiness_cell" "cell_per_az" {
    + cell_name               = "us-east-1a-failover-cell-for-subnet-subnet-070696086c5864da1"
    ...
  }

# aws_route53recoveryreadiness_cell.cell_per_az["us-east-1b"] will be created
...
```

## IPAM Users

If you're building VPCs using AWS IP Address Manager, this module can help you with building 1 VPC at a time from the same IPAM Pool. It is **not possible** to iterate over this module regarding IPAM VPCs. The technical reason due to the fact that we must [preview a cidr](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/vpc_ipam_preview_next_cidr) before making the VPC in order to calculate the subnet prefixes. You can only preview 1 CIDR at a time since subsequent calls will yield the same CIDR until a VPC allocates it from IPAM.

You can use this module to build multiple IPAM VPCs but they must be created in manual sequence (`-target`).
